# Build a dynamic graph from Madrid data. Find a k-core for each graph (timestamp) and compare the k-cores, how did they change?

# Also use build a dynamic graph, calculate (k,r) core for each graph (timestamp) and compare the (k,r) cores, how did they change?
# You need to create a similarity metric between the nodes.
